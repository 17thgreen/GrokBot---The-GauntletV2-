# GPT-6-Astra-Deathmatch

A reproducible sports prediction-market research lab for Logan's Kalshi bot project.
Research source, frozen protocols, results, failed hypotheses and execution audits
are preserved here. No live order-enabled strategy has been validated or deployed.

## Current result

The Q6 simplification screen selected the core allocator with its three optional
features disabled. On 31 repeatedly examined NFL games, one shared $5,000 account,
250-contract event cap and assumed early queue of 3,300, completed simulated net
was **$345.24**, versus **$201.52** for the original router. At queue 10,000 it was
$75.90 versus $10.35. These are hypothetical historical executions, not live P&L.

The extra two-sided flow gate, cash earmark and portfolio ranking were unnecessary
to retain the improvement on this sample. Common budgeting, quote sizing,
offset-order handling and the chosen-pair margin check remain bundled.

Historical source files are imported without refactoring so their original hashes
and regression anchors retain meaning. Archive READMEs may refer to their original
standalone kit; the repository's artifact policy below applies to this checkout.

## Run the current unit suite

Python 3.12, standard library:

```bash
cd nfl_factorial_lab_20260921
python -m unittest -v test_replay_v2 test_queue_policies test_completion test_timing test_adaptive test_factorial test_analysis
```

The imported Q6 run passed 94 unit tests, 36 independent financial-ledger checks,
and 10 exact prior fill/order-ledger regressions. Full replay/ledger verification
requires the indexed external inputs and compressed ledgers; unit tests do not.

## Data and provenance

Code, protocols, reports, JSON summaries, frozen hashes and tests are in Git.
Large/binary captures, normalized data and compressed ledgers remain in the
previously delivered research kits. `provenance/ARCHIVES.json` identifies kits by
filename, size and SHA-256; `EXTERNAL_ARTIFACTS.json` indexes omitted file bytes.
These indexes are not downloads. Obtain the matching kit from the project owner
or the existing project deliverables; run `scripts/restore_kit.py` to validate and
restore the indexed files. No claim is made that cloning alone supplies all data.

No third-party repository checkout, credentials, private communications or unrelated
project files are imported. No license for upstream source/data is inferred;
source manifests retain attribution and provenance for their original inputs.

## Working rule

Commit the hypothesis and frozen specification before execution, then commit the
implementation checkpoint and verified results with a clear status. Preserve
failed attempts and negative outcomes. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

The next research step is an isolated test of the **actual chosen-pair price
check**, with the original router's timing and sizing held fixed. That check
is frozen in `nfl_paircheck_lab_20260922`. The registry records a Q7 Arm B
kill (Cap-SR row and S4 KXNCAAFGAME fee+queue row) and records frozen rehab
pass 1 (PR38) and pass 2 (PR47), with desk-verified `q3300_d0.25_B.json` sha256
`370ccbcf342db59aa1697d448d3274791cf17c015d8e9eead17d788fbe79ffb5` and
`q3300_d0.25_D.json` sha256
`fc38cfbc134ca313a6cd2b8763ef49c3a56f6b5cc763c50f82e2b4545cda898f`. The
in-tree pair-check result file remains `NOT_RUN_INPUTS_MISSING`
(`scenarios_executed` 0). Rehab result files in this checkout also record
`scenarios_executed` 0. The read-only reconciliation memo
`lab/governance/astra/packets/q7_reconciliation_20260924/Q7_RECONCILIATION_MEMO_2026-09-24.md`
(PR51, on main) is documentation and is not a score. This paragraph does not
report Q7 P&L. Fresh-game validation remains a separate gate. The prospective
recorder (ADMIT-1) in `nfl_prospective_recorder_20260922/` was deployed on
2026-09-22. Fleet evidence is
`17thgreen/Grokbot-Deathmatch-Dedicated-Repo` commit `1825ec8c`. ADMIT-1 is now
